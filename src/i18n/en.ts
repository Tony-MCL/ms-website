      "Morning Coffee Labs started from a simple need: better flow and better overview in work that is often complex, full of dependencies — and where changes happen along the way. We don’t believe more “system” always means more control. Often it’s the opposite: control comes from clear choices, predictability, and tools that don’t get in the way.",
